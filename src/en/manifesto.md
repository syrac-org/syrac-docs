# Manifesto

Paragliding competitions are incredible events. You get to race with dozens of pilots across majestic landscapes, using gear which is nothing short of an engineering marvel. However, there are three important limitations:

- scoring is too obscure
- competitions are too expensive
- weather has too much influence

The goal of Syrac is to propose an alternative to standard paragliding by solving these issues.

## Scoring

Both local and international XC competitions have settled for an ever-changing way of computing the score of each pilot for a given flight. Scoring formulas have reached complexity levels such that you cannot know who is the winner of a task or a competition when you land.

Pilots have to wait for GPS tracks to be processed by closed-source software implementing loosely-defined specifications[^1] in order to elect their winner. Even though the reasons for introducing such complexity can be justified, it can also be argued that current evolution of scoring is hurting competitiveness.

Syrac addresses this issue by coming back to the essence of a race: time. The only thing that matters in a leaderboard is the time it took a pilot to complete the task from the Start of Speed Section (SSS) to the End of Speed Section (ESS).

## Cost

Paragliding is an expensive sport. Equipment constitutes a significant budget, since complete competition gear can easily cost more than 6000â‚¬, and has to be changed fairly often. Local competitions are fairly affordable, but international competitions often involves long-haul flights, hotel bookings, logistics costs as well as registration fees.

This cost of entry restricts high-level competition access to wealthy pilots.
