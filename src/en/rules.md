# Rules

Syrac is designed to have a few simple rules, which are described here.
If you think some of these rules are not fair or could be improved, feel free to [suggest a change][1].

## Task

Everyone can create tasks using either built-in XCTrack features or third-party tools. There are some restrictions regarding the tasks that can be submitted:

- tasks must have a Start of Speed Section (SSS) and an End of Speed Section (ESS)
- tasks must have between 0 and 20 turnpoints, excluding SSS and ESS
- turnpoint radius must be between 100m and 100km
- optimized task distance between SSS and ESS must be between 5km and 500km

In order to prevent spam, free users can create a maximum of 10 tasks per 24-hour window.

## Flight

Everyone can submit attempts for all tasks, without limits.
You can submit multiple attempts to the same task (or different ones) during the same day. Tracks should be submitted as IGC files with a valid signature.

## Cheating

The following actions are considered cheating.
Cheating users will first receive a warning, and then be permanently banned from the platform should they attempt to cheat again.

* submitting a flight track which is not yours
* submitting a forged IGC file
