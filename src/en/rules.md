# Rules

Syrac is designed to have a few simple rules, which are described here. If you think one of these rules is not fair or could be improved, feel free to [open an issue][1].

## Task

Everyone can create tasks using the [task creator][2]. There are some restrictions what kind of task can be submitted:

- task distance between SSS and ESS should be between 5km and 500km
- turnpoint radius should be between 100m and 100km

In order to prevent spam, you need at least one pilot to complete your task before being able to submit the next one.

## Flight

Everyone can submit attempts for a given task, without any limits. You can submit multiple attempts to the same task (or different ones) during the same day. Tracks should be submitted as IGC files with a valid signature.

## Cheating

The following actions are considered cheating. Cheating users will first receive a warning, and then be permanently banned from the platform should they attempt to cheat again.

* submitting a flight track which is not yours
* submitting a forged IGC file
